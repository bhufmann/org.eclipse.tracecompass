# Introduction

The purpose of **Trace Compass** is to facilitate the integration of
tracing and monitoring tools into Eclipse, to provide out-of-the-box
generic functionalities/views and provide extension mechanisms of the
base functionalities for application specific purposes.

This guide goes over the internal components of the Trace Compass
framework. It should help developers trying to add new capabilities
(support for new trace type, new analysis or views, etc.) to the
framework. End-users, using the RCP for example, should not have to
worry about the concepts explained here.

##Trace Compass Server

For development `for Trace Compass Trace Server` see the [Trace Server Developer Guide](https://github.com/eclipse-tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/blob/master/doc/trace-server/trace-server-dev-guide.md).
