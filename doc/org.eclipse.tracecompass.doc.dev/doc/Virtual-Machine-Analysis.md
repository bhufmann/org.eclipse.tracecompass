# Virtual Machine Analysis

*Note*: The Virtual Machine Analysis that was previously part of Trace
Compass has moved to the Trace Compass Incubator where it is undergoing
active development. The analyses that were previously in Trace Compass
are now available as part of the "Virtual Machine And Container
Analysis" feature of the Incubator.

Please refer to [the incubator development
documentation](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Incubator_Guidelines)
for how to contribute to the Incubator.
